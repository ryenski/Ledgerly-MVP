## Boundaries

- React owns presentation state, forms, error rendering, and Workspace overview screens.
- The Workspace overview renders Invalid Ledger State details from `WorkspaceSummary.ledgerValidation` and blocks unsafe Approval and MVP Report affordances while validation is invalid.
- The Source Account setup UI collects bank or credit-card Source Accounts and optional Opening Balances, then refreshes the Workspace summary returned from the native write.
- The CSV Import setup UI collects a Source Account, raw CSV contents, and a Source Mapping, then stores normalized Statement Rows in SQLite Staging Area tables without writing to Beancount.
- CSV Import computes an Import Fingerprint from normalized row identity, scopes deduplication to the Source Account, and skips duplicates even when prior rows are already accounted.
- Suggested Entry review reads pending Statement Rows, previews the Beancount entry, exposes Journal Detail, and approves non-transfer entries into Monthly Transaction Files.
- Categorization Rules are user-confirmed SQLite records scoped to Source Account by default, visible/editable in the Workspace overview, and used to prefill future Standard Suggested Entries before any future AI suggestion layer.
- Approval can offer a Categorization Rule after a non-transfer entry is approved, but the rule is not created until the Founder-Operator confirms it.
- BYO AI Adapter configuration is optional SQLite state. When configured, Ledgerly sends Curated Ledger Context over stdin to the local adapter command and reads a structured AI Suggestion from stdout.
- Curated Ledger Context includes the Statement Row, Source Account, chart of accounts, Categorization Rules, similar approved entries, and business profile. It does not grant direct Workspace file access to the adapter.
- AI Suggestions can prefill review fields and expose confidence/explanation, but they never write to Beancount; Approval remains required.
- Transfer Matches are suggested from opposite-signed same-date Statement Rows across different Source Accounts, never auto-approved, and approved as one balanced Beancount Transfer Entry that marks both linked Statement Rows accounted.
- One-sided transfer hints can appear when a Statement Row description looks like a transfer or payment, but they do not claim another row or write an approval without a linked match.
- Approval retains each source Statement Row as accounted in the Staging Area, stores the Ledgerly entry id and ledger file path in SQLite, and writes minimal Beancount metadata for `ledgerly_entry_id`, `import_fingerprint`, `source_account`, and `source_file_name`.
- Broken Provenance is surfaced separately from structural Ledger Validation by scanning accounted Statement Rows against Ledgerly Entry Metadata in the readable ledger files.
- MVP Reports are derived from the readable Beancount ledger files, not from unapproved SQLite Staging Area rows. Reports currently parse Ledgerly-written opening balances and included Monthly Transaction Files to render Income Statement, Expense Breakdown, Source Account Balances, and a basic Balance Sheet.
- The Golden Path validation test exercises the native workflow from App-Created Workspace setup through CSV import, Approval, Transfer Match approval, Ledger Validation, Staging Area provenance, invalid-ledger blocking, and MVP Reports.
- `src/lib/workspace/api.ts` is the frontend boundary to native Workspace commands.
- Tauri commands translate frontend calls into Rust domain operations.
- `src-tauri/src/workspace/` owns Workspace filesystem layout, manifest handling, Beancount rendering, SQLite initialization, path validation, Source Account ledger writes, CSV import staging, Source Mapping persistence, and structural ledger validation with file-aware error messages.
- The Workspace folder owns all accounting data needed for this slice. No Ledgerly cloud account is required.
- `.agents/skills/work-ready-issues/` owns the local AFK workflow for sequentially selecting, implementing, reviewing, merging, and continuing through GitHub issues labeled `ready-for-agent`.

## Current Constraints

- Only App-Created Workspaces are supported.
- `USD` is the only supported MVP currency.
- Validation is structural and local. It runs after Ledgerly creates a Workspace, when opening a Workspace, and when the UI rechecks the ledger after External Ledger Edits.
- The UI includes editable path fields so Workspace create/open works even when native directory picker support is unavailable in development.
- Source Account setup appends valid Beancount directives to the readable ledger files rather than storing canonical account setup only in SQLite.
- CSV Imports are tied to one Source Account. Imported Statement Rows live in SQLite Staging Area tables and do not mutate the Beancount ledger.
- Import deduplication is scoped to `(source_account, import_fingerprint)` and does not attempt global duplicate ledger detection.
- Approval is blocked during Invalid Ledger State. Approved non-transfer entries write to `transactions/YYYY-MM.bean`, include a Source Account posting plus a balancing Ledger Account posting, and mark the Statement Row accounted in the Staging Area.
- Approved transfers write one transaction between the two Source Accounts and mark both linked Statement Rows accounted with the same Ledgerly entry id and ledger file path.
- MVP Reports are blocked during Invalid Ledger State and cover Ledgerly-written `.bean` syntax for the MVP reporting surface rather than arbitrary Beancount.
- Raw CSV row details, AI explanations, and confidence scores remain in Ledgerly-managed local data or transient review state and are not written as Beancount metadata.
- Tauri npm packages and Rust crates are pinned to the same `2.0.x` minor line to avoid dev-time version mismatch errors.
- Native Tauri dialog/opener plugin integration remains a future compatibility task.
